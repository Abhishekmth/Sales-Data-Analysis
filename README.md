   It involves utilization of advanced analytical tools to uncover trends, patterns, and regional insights, facilitating informed decision-making and targeted strategies

### Tools
   
   • Excel-Data Cleaning

### Data Cleaning/Prepration

   In the initial data prepration phase, we performed the following tasks-
    1.Data loading amnd inspection
    2.Handling missing values
    3.Data cleaning and  formatting
    
### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

   1.what is the overall sales trend?   
   2.which products are top sellers?     
   3.which product gets maximum discount?

### Recommendations

  Based on analysis, we recommend the following actions:
     -Focus is needed in East region to maximize sales.
     -Maximun discount is enjoyed by consumer segment nearly 50% so other segments needs to be given leverage.
     -Implement a customer segmentation to target high-LTV customers effectively

### Limitations
   I had to remove all zero values from quantity and profit columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusuions from the analysis . there are still a few
  outliners even after the omissions but even then we can sill see there is a positive trend.
